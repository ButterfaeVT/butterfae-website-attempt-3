# Problems with Humantek
Traced art

Wildly high prices even with discounts

artists are pushy and will ignore being turned down to keep trying to get commissions

Supportive of AI

Fake reviews on sites such as trustpilot

# General Shadyness
1 artist asked for different payment methods from 2 separate clients

customer promotion videos look super cut up and are heavily edited in at least some cases

testimonials on their website have all different artists, never mentions the same one twice

according to Chris, they were hounded by their artist to make a good review shouting them out

if you're getting as many clients as your references and reviews seem to suggest, why do they need to go after comms so hard

example art varies wildly between pieces sent by the artist and sometimes different artists send the same pieces

# Points with Paragraphs
Here is where I will re-write out all of the points mentioned above with my thoughts, linking to the apropriate screenshots or sites as needed

## Problems with Humantek

### Traces Art
Humantek Traces at least some of their art.  The biggest example I have of this is when HimmyVT sent references [HimmySnuggly](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Humantek%20Comm%2FHimmySnuggly.png) and [HimmyWow](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Humantek%20Comm%2FHimmyWow.png) they were directly traced to create his commission [Emote](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Humantek%20Comm%2FHimmy%20animated%20Emote%20Humantek.gif) [BRB](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Humantek%20Comm%2Fbrb%20by%20bella.mp4) and [Ending Soon](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Humantek%20Comm%2Fending%20soon%20by%20bella.mp4) screens which he never asked them to do.  when confronted on it, they said it was because he [wanted the same,](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FWanted%20the%20same.png) but even some emotes seem like they may be traced from templates but this is never indicated by the artists who actually claim that what they do is all [from scratch](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FNix%20Images%2FAccording%20to%20Clients%20Ideas.png) in some cases (link images for template looking ones a bit back)

### Wildly High Prices, Even with Discounts
The prices of their work is largely above many other artists.  As an example, StillChris bought 5 sub badges for [25USD each](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FChris%20Invoice) which seems to be on the very upper end of what people charge on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=sub%20badges&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=9c359923f350443d89f5c7183f72c33f&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=sub%20badges) or [Vgen](https://vgen.co/search?q=sub%20badges), most seeming to be hovering more around the 5-15 USD range.

Himmy bought 2 screens and an animated emote for [220USD](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FHimmy%20Images%2FHimmy%20Invoice) at a supposed 50% discount, while most similar scenes I could find were 20-100USD on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=stream%20ending%20screen&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=8ed64023827341db819bad82f6a77865&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=stream%20ending%20screen) and [Vgen](https://vgen.co/search?q=stream%20endeng%20screen) depending on the detail and an animated emote seems to hover about 15-35USD from a quick search, also on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=animated%20emote&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=6530535014d44a00a7948f02e736cc3f&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=animated%20emote) and [Vgen](https://vgen.co/search?q=animated%20emote).

### Artists are Pushy and Keep Doorknocking Commissions 
Artists will doorknock commissions, even if you tell them you are not interested.  This has happened to [me](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FMy%20Images%2FDoorknocking%20Me), [Nochu](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FNochu%20Images%2FNochu%20HTA%20DM%20List), [Brent](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Doorknocking%20Brent), and most assuredly others too.  This even happens after you tell them you are not interested when they initially show up in a twitch chat.


### The Company is Supportive of AI
In a [blog post](https://humantekart.com/increasing-role-of-ai-in-the-animation-industry/) from their website on April 19th 2023, they say that AI has appeared in movies as far back as the early [2000's](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FMisc%20HumanTek%20Images%2FAI%20in%20the%20early%202000s.png) with a good reception, but this may be referencing AI like in 2001 A Space Odyssey.  They also say that artists [shouldn't fear the progress of AI in art](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FMisc%20HumanTek%20Images%2FAI%20not%20be%20feared%2C%20Sparks%20Creativity.png) as it is more likely to spark creativity and innovation.


### At least of some of the Trustpilot and probably other recommendations are faked
I was able to hop on a call with [Puppers19(AKA: SGTBLANK)](https://www.twitch.tv/puppers19) who was able to confirm for me that the [Trustpilot review](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FMisc%20HumanTek%20Images%2Fbellaa-rowan-sgt-blank.jpg) of his commission on [Bella's Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/EvQdlN) was fake.  I had noticed that the speech pattern was different as well as the credits of his Vtuber modelwhen I was checking out his twitch channel but he told me definitively that he never shouted her out in any way form or fashion.


## General Shadiness

### Asking for different methods of payment from different clients
When being paid, they will sometimes ask for different methods of payment off the bat instead of having a standardized way.  Himmy was asked to pay through [Insert] while Nix was asked if they had [Zelle](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FNix%20Images%2FHave%20you%20got%20a%20Zelle.png), which feels a bit strange, but who's to say?

### Customer Promotion videos look heavily edited, possibly a script
When watching the customer review videos, there were a lot of jumpy cuts on a lot of them and some of them almost seemed like they were cut off mid review.  possibly to cut out any negative press?  IDK, but it seems super sketchy to me.
Most jumpy editing example here: [Herky_Lee's review](https://youtu.be/G67mY-fWzWA?si=A_KcEaPbs-OQkN2n)

### Testimonials on their website never showcase the same artist
the [testimonials on their website](https://humantekart.com/testimonials/) show a bunch of tweets shouting out their artists, but they never say the same name more than twice, and I only saw 1 name mentioned twice in the whole list which I screenshotted [here](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FMisc%20HumanTek%20Images%2FHumantek%20Testimonials) just in case it is changed.

### According to some people, they were heavily encouraged to write a shoutout post
Chris was eavily encouraged to make a shoutout post on [Twitter](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FChris%20Images%2FStill%20Chris%20Shaniqua%20Shoutout.png) and [Trustpilot](obsidian://open?vault=Video%20Ideas&file=Humantek%20art%2FPics%2FChris%20Images%2FLeading%20Art%20Companies.png) and Himmy was asked to in a   Puppers said that they never pressured them however, so unsure when or why they do if they do.

### Amount of References doesn't seem to match the desperation for commissions
Humantek artists will often be able to send or share a plethora of art as a reference when talking to them about their art, but they always seem to be looking for commissions and doorknocking in streams to try and drum up more work for themselves.  If they get as much work as the amount of references seem to suggest, why do they need to constantly be finding new work?  

### I've had multiple artists send the same image as a reference
I have seen multiple humantek artists reach out to people and give them reference art that was also given by another artist as their own reference.  who actually does the art?  are they all the same person using multiple accounts?  are they just showing random art from a pool of references?

### Why is their paypal at the bottom of the website?
Their paypal, QR code, as well as links to their paypal are at the bottom of their website.  this feels a little strange, but I dont think its technically wrong to do.

### Will leave communities after getting comms
example: Shaniqua left Chris' community after getting his commission
