Humantek is an art company that seems to have a lot of shady practices.  I have personally had a few issues with them, but after 3 of my friends overpaid for art from them that was well below their expectations, I decided to look into them a bit and once I started, it just seemed to look worse and worse at every turn.  I've decided to compile what I've found through browsing their websites, their social medias, and interviewing other people who have interacted with them in order to share my conclusions, but also to let potential clients of theirs draw their own more informed conclusions.

# People I Interviewed About HTA
In order to give the most accurate information I can in this document, I have talked to a wide variety of people who have either commissioned HTA, been contacted by them, or are artists themselves.  Some of these people wish to remain anonymous so I have used aliases in their case, but I have given links to everyone who was willing to be named in this project of mine.

# My Main Problems with Humantek
In this category, I will outline the most problematic things that I found while looking into the company.

## Tracing Art
Human Tek seems to trace a portion of their art.  Whether this is directly from the references given to them or from a template seems to vary, but the biggest example I have is when HimmyVT ordered from them, his reference emotes were copied almost 1-1.  The [emote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhNncgdto4WRjO3FRNxLyeriecDTvli4/view?usp=drive_link) he paid for copies the hair, eyes, facial structure, and mouth from the [this emote,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TgO_95yNq69u_hFLzjfehamNc-VMEjRe/view?usp=drive_link)) which he provided as a reference.  I've overlaid the two images [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmdCTpq-y6zV7Zl2IPOpLkU2d26PW3ME/view?usp=drive_link)  The [BRB Screen](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBtOSXc0MptpXzuiD0_rWl5AIodnMwAd/view?usp=drive_link) and the [Ending Soon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GgwqZOBA4Cz1S_Dpa3EOqRlLcUrwcMpy/view?usp=drive_link) also draw heavily from this emote as well as another [reference](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Ba0lP0UcRIDDCUTx9cv1S0stZITO6op/view?usp=drive_link) he provided to the artist.  When confronted with this fact, they said it was because he [wanted the same](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13WmAQ2QAi8OMQwkZOCoSL_EXpw2-ZQZY/view?usp=drive_link) which he never indicated.

She then provided him with an updated version of the [emote](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kbNcHI8apdbsCF0Duz2bivy5tkGYSMl0/view?usp=drive_link) with a different head in another style which didn't meet the original design specifications given with discussing the character, but this may have been because they said their mental state was disturbed by the interaction.

Additionally, they seem to use templates despite saying that they make everything from [scratch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c09cDYDdiI_oGDTwq_Evy4zwR8fmEUfC/view?usp=drive_link) 

## High Prices Discounts
A lot of times the prices quoted by the artists will be above what I've seen for the market average, especially for comparable quality of work.  in some cases like with StillChris, who paid [25USD each](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dUv5f_b0SHtsVyoHItmCLEEjxpR3IeY1685thtbIOGs/edit?usp=drive_link) for 5 sub badges, all 5 were the [same badge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13N2kNSHkaVq9n81jTl5TLlOvrhp70bHv/view?usp=drive_link) but with different colors and effects layered on top while on places such as [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=sub%20badges&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=9c359923f350443d89f5c7183f72c33f&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=sub%20badges) and [Vgen](https://vgen.co/search?q=sub%20badges) you can get more sub badges for cheaper prices.

In another instance, Himmy VT commissioned [3 items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1awyD5iAXm5GoMz4IfCyYi9NxJigayXtG0UHQP00z-Ek/edit?usp=drive_link) for a total of [220USD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saKQhSBq06f-N3-z8pxuZsmBw8OTTKYaYPrx7dovkWo/edit?usp=drive_link) while similar emotes, also animated, can be found for about 15-35USD on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=animated%20emote&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=6530535014d44a00a7948f02e736cc3f&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=animated%20emote) and [Vgen](https://vgen.co/search?q=animated%20emote) and the screens that I can find closest in price were a much wider range of 20-100USD also on [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=stream%20ending%20screen&source=top-bar&ref_ctx_id=8ed64023827341db819bad82f6a77865&search_in=everywhere&search-autocomplete-original-term=stream%20ending%20screen) and [Vgen.](https://vgen.co/search?q=stream%20endeng%20screen)
Humantek Artists also will often discounts saying that they are giving a huge discount just for you and not to tell other people in [some cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3HaTBF49uplQJUdr2oQI-pDNDTFTnJOt5lZiUMZAf4/edit?usp=drive_link).  These discounts often don't even bring the price down to the same level as the other prices I was able to find on sites as shown above.

## Artists Are Pushy and Keep Doorknocking Comms Even If You Say You Are Uninterested
Many HumanTek artists will doorknock commissions even if you tell them that you aren't interested.  This has happened to [Me,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JWadgwXXfZwfSNXrIdoJKvumO8PRSvzRX36ksa9XET4/edit?usp=drive_link) [Nochu,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10K5C_Kj7zmiYeMsjen45rCosi8K1dv7_MXaIzix7phM/edit?usp=drive_link) [Brent,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SL-qFjCPPSsOFRENYwdzDWkPGPdRsUrr2G42aYJ51ak/edit?usp=drive_link) and I would bet that its happened to many other people.  They will strike up conversations with people in twitch chats or a shared server if they think they can get a comm from them.  

## The Company is Supportive of AI
in a [blog post](https://humantekart.com/increasing-role-of-ai-in-the-animation-industry/) from their website on April 19th 2023, they say that AI has been movies as far back as the [2000's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SLt0gSqryYbgmPDxHSXnSnBShfGDms8O/view?usp=drive_link) with good reception.  I did some digging on this topic and came up empty, so this may be referencing depictions of AI such as the AI in A Space Odyssey, but this doesn't make much sense to me either.  They also said that artists [shouldn't fear the progress of AI in art](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xds804yq32mMxMnxeOlKBTVzS1AUMVNK/view?usp=drive_link) as it is more likely to spark creativity and innovation.  

## At Least Some of the Trustpilot Reviews and Probably Other Recommendations Are Faked
I was lucky enough to speak to some of the clients of Humantek and one of them told me that the Trustpilot review of his commission which included a shoutout for their Vtuber models is fake as they never gave a shoutout of any kind and their Vtuber was from an artist on the site [booth.](https://booth.pm/en) The specific people I talked to about their reviews who told me that they were faked wished to remain anonymous, so I will not be providing any specific names here, but if you look through their reviews on [Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/humantekart.com) there are a lot of positive reviews that seem overwhelmingly glowing, follow a pattern like a template, have very strange message structure and composition(speaking on the english reviews only as I do not speak the other languages I saw), and/or the reviewer usually only has 1 review.  

As an additional pattern I found interesting, I skimmed the Trustpilot reviews and the dates they were posted and noticed that they were getting a lot of reviews within days of each other and also a lot of days where they would get multiple reviews on a single day.  There was a brief period where they received no reviews for 19 days, but that was the only time I saw a gap that long all the way back to January 2, 2024, which is about 8.5 months back at the time of writing this, most gaps being around 1 or 5 days, but almost always falling within that if not exactly that long of a gap.

# General Shadiness
In this category, I will outline and showcase what I feel are either sketchy, disrespectful, or just generally kinda icky practices of the artists or company.

## Asking for Different Methods of Payment From Different Clients
When being paid for a commission, I believe that there is usually a standard method of payment, especially if its a company running the operation.  these artists often ask for Paypal as in the case of [StillChris,]([Chris%20Invoice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dUv5f_b0SHtsVyoHItmCLEEjxpR3IeY1685thtbIOGs/edit?usp=drive_link)) [HimmyVT,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1saKQhSBq06f-N3-z8pxuZsmBw8OTTKYaYPrx7dovkWo/edit?usp=drive_link) and [Spaceman,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c3HaTBF49uplQJUdr2oQI-pDNDTFTnJOt5lZiUMZAf4/edit?usp=drive_link) but when talking to my friend Nix, the same person who did HimmyVT's commission asked for [Zelle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q9-yO9l9CS4zUGttka2Y9N5ImQLt6x61/view?usp=drive_link) before any other form of payment.  This struck me a bit weird as normally I see artists go through paypal and then maybe another method if that doesn't work out for some reason.

## Customer Promotion Videos are Severely Edited and Sometimes Feel Like a Script
The shared experience videos on their website all feel rather strangely edited and in some cases like they are reading from a script.  [Herky_Lee's video](https://youtu.be/G67mY-fWzWA?si=sFH43v1CRD3HhOMD) for example is very jumpy and has cuts every few words and [Asaie's video](https://youtu.be/oJnFloi6u_Q?si=mfNgAtj4RXbXMjEl) is very clearly being read from a script.  Neither of these things are proof of them being dishonest, but for a recommendation video, I personally feel like a more natural video would feel a bit more genuine even if it extended the run time by a bit.  

##  Testimonials on Their Website Rarely Mention the Same Artist More Than Once
The [testimonials on their website](https://humantekart.com/testimonials/) showcase tweets from clients shouting out their artists, but they never show the same artist more than once with one exception.  This may be because they want to show multiple reviews of different artists, but if an artist was doing really good, I would imagine that they would want them to be front and center so that they could get more commissions and they already have one artist with more than one review.  Screenshots of the testimonials page included [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AbYMzsdto46iqQcD3NI1bthxuYpOHz2lJpP8Rx6M3-E/edit?usp=drive_link)

## They Often Ask for a Shoutout Post and/or Other Forms of Recommendation
After the work is done, or even before in some cases, they will ask for shoutouts on [twitter, instagram,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wv_KUvc7kPSHV6GP8tpo4yHtOPx-F--I/view?usp=drive_link) [discord,](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tV71SJ1AMna206mAh-sAR2wuRoz42j5f/view?usp=drive_link) and/or [Trustpilot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mb1b4oFqMGtP3nd96CsFymlHqN92Rbgd/view?usp=drive_link).  Sometimes they even make panels for the client to put under their stream.  I understand asking for referrals when the work is finished, and its a definitely common courtesy to give your artist a shoutout after they do work for you, especially if you like it, but asking almost a week in advance like in the case for [HimmyVT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tV71SJ1AMna206mAh-sAR2wuRoz42j5f/view?usp=drive_link) just feels weird.  

## The Amount of References Doesn't Match the Desperation for Commissions
HumanTek Artists always seem desperate for commissions.  Doorknocking for commissions in streams and on discord and not just leaving you alone when you say no has been a complaint that I and others have had with them, but they have reference after reference if you ask them for some which implies that they've had a lot of work.  if they're getting so much work to have so many references, shouldn't it be spreading from word of mouth rather than having to hound random people on social media to get them to buy from them?  

I fully get that being an artist can be hard, especially if you're trying to make a living off of it, but I really don't think that harassing people for commissions is the best way to go about this.  I believe that a better way to get your name out there if you are still trying to do so is to join a commission site like Vgen or Fiver, post to twitter to showcase your art as you work on new and different things, and make content that's cool, funny, or relatable.  I know I'm personally more willing to commission an artist I don't know under these conditions over one who showed up and started begging for work time and again after I tell them no.
## Multiple Artists Have Sent the Same References
Many artists will share references that are super similar to each other, and on their twitters, they all use art that is credited to other artists with no distinction between that and their own commissions.  Some artists have also sent art as their own when asked for references that other artists have in their portfolios such as [Eloise Ethan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Bc4x3lwO1vd3AGU9a1RsBUJeU5c7jEw/view?usp=drive_link) sending an image to brent that [Bliss_Bella](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qedznufiKCrFEqhCV1W81V3lRhIdEYHQ/view?usp=drive_link) has on her artstation portfolio.  that's the only example I have specifically, but I have not delved extremely thoroughly into the rabbit hole that is all of the twitter users affiliated with Humantek Art.  I've included a list of some of the [[Humantek art/Interviews and Notes/Humantek Artists\|Humantek Artists]] I've looked at the twitters of here if anyone wishes to look for themselves without tracking them down.  

## Will Leave Communities After Getting Commissions in Some Cases
Sometimes after finishing a commission, the artist will leave the server if they joined from a stream, and in some cases, the whole account is deleted and they reach out on a seperate account.  I have no idea if this is in any way a tactic to get more commissions or make them harder to track down, but this has happened to 2 of the 3 people I know who commissioned HTA artists and the 3rd I know at least has a 2nd account as they reached out on it after their other account was blocked.

## Why is Their Paypal at the Bottom of Their Website

I know some people will just have their link to stuff like this in places, like on the back of their car with the tag, "Buy me a drink!" or something, but for a company to do it, it just seems like a really strange thing to do.  like if you were to go into a shop to buy something and they just had a bucket that said, "give us free money!" which is kinda just tipping culture, but that's usually reserved for after a service is rendered and is delivered at the same time as the payment for said service and not just a thing to do without reason.

## They have five different addresses for four different branches

The company posts its addresses for its 4 branches at the bottom of their [website](https://humantekart.com/) and also under their [contact us](https://humantekart.com/contact-us/) page.  That's a pretty normal thing for a business to do, but they have 5 different addresses for their 4 different branches.  The addresses at the [bottom of their page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GmJ_FZvrKErrIs2K0XSS6FIt-iStied2/view?usp=drive_link) are the ones people will usually see, but under the [contact](https://drive.google.com/file/d/168XwUIki3c0CN979bwKsI3jrdxiBhpf1/view?usp=drive_link) page, the UK branch leads to a different address that's roughly 90 miles away.

I dont know why they have 5 addresses for 4 locations and why all of them lead to places where it seems they aren't, but it seems a bit strange as a company since having the wrong address makes it harder to contact them as a company.
