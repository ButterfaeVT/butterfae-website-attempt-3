lots of streamers, esp smaller ones, often encounter artists fishing for commissions, and the biggest group I see isn't self employed artists, but from the company Humantek art

many of these artists share similarly random art styles and I've even seen multiple artists share the same piece of art as another of their artists

They dont take no for an answer and will often push for commission even after you tell them no multiple times

the company praises the use of AI in a blog post from April 2023

likes and reposts strange assortment of memes and posts on artist twitters

Their addresses at the bottom of the website lead to random places such as shops, apartments, and a train station as well as a completely different location in the about me section

They have their paypal in the bottom in case you want to send them free money :D

scam with fake discounts, discounted price is at least as high if not higher than what you can find for the same thing

potentially fake reviews accrediting other peoples art to themselves Puppers19 model being attributed to an artist on booth and a review about Bella Rowan saying she is good for Vtuber models(update: some are definitely fake, SGTBlank Trustpilot review for example)

have had an artist tell me they are different from humantek artists when I said their art looked similar to it and they said they are different and want to work with their clients but on their twitter it shows that they are actually affiliated with Humantek and their art is exactly the same kind of art as every other artist

Prices can vary wildly, even with the same artist

demonstrative pieces vary wildly between people sent to

if so many clients as their plethora of references seem to suggest, why do they need to go begging for clients or give sob stories about needing money for rent?

Seems to be more evidence of the Pakistani branch existing than any other with some of their YT videos

Why not use Vgen or Fiverr, makes it all easier to find.  discord and twitter makes it hard to keep track of as everyone can be shown something else from each other on discord and twitter the artists interact with meaningless drivel and it makes things hard to find

customer satisfaction videos sound like they're reading from scripts half the time

art never mentions the artist that did it on their website or socials so no way to ask for a specific person other than word of mouth.

litter evidence everywhere.  show the UK map difference from the about us to the listed ab bottom

according to talking to people who worked with them, they might hound people to try to force them to write a review about them when they finish.

I dont think I saw the same name twice when looking at the names on the testimonials on their website

Customer rating videos are super edited and feel like the person might just be reading from a script

maybe each artist can control the ammount they charge to allow them to try and get the most out of people by lowering if necessary to get them to buy more or any at all.

Traced Art, Proof from Himmy's comms being traced from Nochu's emotes

had the same artist ask for payment from 2 different methods, why?

will leave communities after getting commissions
