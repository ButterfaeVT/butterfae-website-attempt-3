#Humantekart 
## Where did you meet them


## What references did they send


## Did they quote a price undiscounted?


## How much did they charge


## How fast was the turnaround


## were they pushy


## did they push for a post of some kind referencing their work?


## did they refer you to any actual channels to showcase their art?  how did they verify they were legit















## Misc Notes
Emotes were directly traced from references given by Himmy, including some of Nochu's(mutal Friend) art

Showed me the scenes for Himmy as reference before even telling him that they were in production

After Himmy blocked them, they sent an Email trying to continue to get more commissions as well as more Discord friend requests from alt accounts
