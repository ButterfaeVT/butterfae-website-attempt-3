#Humantekart 
## Where did you meet them
met them on stream, they approached him

## What references did they send
already forwarded in DM's

## Did they quote a price undiscounted?
gave an amount then said the lowest they could do, never said how much the discount was, just let him do the math

## How much did they charge
125USD
25USD each for 5 sub badges

## How fast was the turnaround
really fast, didn't have a specific time frame

## were they pushy
absolutely, kept pushing comms.  They created the project and brainstormed the project and then said how much it would cost afterwards.

## did they push for a post of some kind referencing their work?
yes, they pushed for Trustpilot and they asked for twitter, but he doesn't really use twitter

## did they refer you to any actual channels to showcase their art?  how did they verify they were legit
They referenced Chilidan halfway into the project.


## Who was your HumanTek Artist
@shaniquawhite










## Misc Notes
it saddens him how predatory they are towards new streamers.  new/na√Øve streamers are more likely to fall for things like this.
