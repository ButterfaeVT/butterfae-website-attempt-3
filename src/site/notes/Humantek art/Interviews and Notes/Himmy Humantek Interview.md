#Humantekart 
## Where did you meet them
First DM'd Himmy on Twitter, he checked out their profile and it seemed at least they weren;t going to just run away with the money and would actually deliver something.
Specifically he looked at [Berryfficial](https://www.twitch.tv/berryfficial) and [sensein3ss](https://www.twitch.tv/sensein3ss)

## What references did they send
in DM's

## Did they quote a price undiscounted?
said it was discounted to half off which would put the whole cost about 440-450 total

## How much did they charge
charged 220 USD for an animated emote and 2 screens

## How fast was the turnaround
recieved first emote version a day after payment
emote was finished 13 days after payment
both screens were finished 1 day after the emote on the 30th of july

## were they pushy
yes

## did they push for a post of some kind referencing their work?
showed up in stream begging for a shoutout

## did they refer you to any actual channels to showcase their art?  how did they verify they were legit
see above














## Misc Notes
Emotes were directly traced from references given by Himmy, including some of Nochu's(mutal Friend) art

Showed me the scenes for Himmy as reference before even telling him that they were in production

After Himmy blocked them, they sent an Email trying to continue to get more commissions as well as more Discord friend requests from alt accounts
