#Humantekart 
## Where did you meet them
met them through a friends server, Bella came to them
talked for a month or so before commission
## What references did they send
They didn't send references, but showed a step by step update of the emote

## Did they quote a price undiscounted?
only hit for discounts on days where they were offereing as a company

## How much did they charge
15 dollars for the emote

## How fast was the turnaround
5 day turnaround for first sketch, 6-7 day for completed work

## were they pushy
got pushier when they realized they knew an artist.
didn't really push so much for comms as much

aparently they really bugged a friend of Puppers to get them to comm art, trying to get to know them on a more personal level, witnessed by Puppers

## did they push for a post of some kind referencing their work?
never really did a twitter or other shoutout.

## did they refer you to any actual channels to showcase their art?  how did they verify they were legit
didn't really show art or references, but Puppers has a good heart so he gaver her a shot.





## Misc notes
definitely proved that the Artstation review is fake, confirmed this in a VC with Puppers
Bella mentioned Wilkins De La Cruz to Puppers specifically
said they might be salting emails in the company form clients emails
she actually called Puppers personally to go over things with him
no accent on the call
check out Scammer Payback 
3mos of living expense from that 220 USD
send it to an offshore account to have it changed
said one of the HT guys was arrested by Scammer Payback the baldest guy in the IT exhibiion video.  said that he was probably a sub executive according to Scammer Payback.
people could be forced into it from debt
seems to maybe be a part of a wider collection of groups
linked in shows more companies in the same address
said that they might bot raid people if they dont like the person
