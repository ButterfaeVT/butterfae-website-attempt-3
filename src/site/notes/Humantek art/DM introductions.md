#Humantekart 
Hey, sorry to message you like this so randomly, my name is Butterfae and I'm another streamer.  I'm putting together a document on Humantek Art as I have reason to believe that they are scamming people and want to get more information from people who have had actual interaction with them.  I saw your panels as a reference from one of their artists so I wanted to reach out.  My discord name is butterfae if you want to reach out there, but if you'd prefer Twitter or Twitch DM's, I'm flexible.
